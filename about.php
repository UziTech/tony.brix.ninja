<p>
When I was nine years old I found QBasic on my parent’s first computer. It
quickly became my favorite game. I have been intrigued by computers and
programming languages ever since.
</p>
<p>
There are about 40 languages in which I have written at least one program. My
favorite languages are Javascript, PHP and C#. I continue to learn more every
day and keep up with today’s advancing technologies.
</p>
<p>
I started my own computer repair business in high school, mostly working for
family members and friends. Also in high school I started freelance
programming thru websites such as GetACoder.com and others. I have worked on
many projects with many different kinds of people and have been able to work
with every one of them successfully.
</p>
<p>
I am a very easy going and open person who thinks logically about every
decision. I consider myself a very lucky person to have found what I want to
do for the rest of my life at a very early age. To answer every high school
counselor’s question, if I had $1,000,000 I would create applications that
make people more efficient.
