<p>When I was nine years old I found QBasic on my parent’s computer. It quickly
became my favorite game. Ever since then I have been intrigued by computers
and programming languages.</p>

<p>There are 41 languages in which I have written at least one program. My
favorite languages are PHP and C# with Java coming in a close third because
of Android. I continue to learn more every day and keep up with today’s
advancing technologies.</p>

<p>I started my own computer repair business in high school, mostly working for
family members and friends. Also in high school I started freelance
programming thru websites such as GetACoder.com and others. I have worked on
many projects with many different kinds of people and have been able to work
with every one of them successfully.</p>

<p>I am a very easy going and open person who thinks logically about every
decision. I consider myself a very lucky person to have found what I want to
do for the rest of my life at a very early age. To answer every high school
counselor’s question, if I had $1,000,000 I would write programs for anybody
and everybody.</p>
